**Seth’s Feedback:**

@everyone Hi all. I finished grading project part 2. Here is my feedback:
- Grade is 7/8
- One of the main issues was that your user stories are not broken intro requirements. If you need help with this, or are not sure what requirements are, please let me know.
- For the UI, generally you did a good job, but please find a better way to submit it with the changes I request for the next milestone. 
- I could not find a mock for leaving an event (US 01.01.02).
- For facilities, you should at least have a location as well as its name.
- Event creation should must be linked to a facility.
- No real issues with the CRC cards.

**One of the main issues was that your user stories are not broken intro requirements**

We are now breaking down the user stories into separate requirements.  We were not clear about this before and have split it up into things that need to be done.

**For the UI, generally you did a good job, but please find a better way to submit it with the changes I request for the next milestone. **

We are splitting the UI in different sections/pages in Figma. We will also export it into the Git Repository as “chunks” with a header. It will be a markdown file instead of one giant png file.

**I could not find a mock for leaving an event (US 01.01.02).**

We have added this in.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae860bb3-1046-4390-b16e-380d5e19632e)

**For facilities, you should at least have a location as well as its name.**

We have added a location for the facilities now. The location is visible when looking at facility details.

**Event creation should must be linked to a facility.**

Event creation now has a facility input area. 

**No real issues with the CRC cards.**

No changes to CRC cards for now. We will add more information if necessary.
